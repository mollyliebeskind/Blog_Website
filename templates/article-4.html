                    Using keyboard arrows, users have the ability to move about the virtual space, entering and 
                    leaving conversations freely as they move closer and further away from others.

                        Seamore was born in Armonk New York a long long long long long time ago. 
                        After doing some stuff in life, he learned of the Liebeskind Dream Team while 
                        floating down a lazy river in Sunriver Oregon. Tails of their sing-a-long sessions
                        inspired him and at once he was captivated by their goofyness. Today Seamore writes
