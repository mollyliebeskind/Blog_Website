                    Michael, Mike, Mickie, Mr. Liebeskind - to the world he goes by many names 
                    but to the people who love him the most, he goes by Dad. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's hard to write a short article about a man who has done so much and means so much. 
                    So we'll break it down...
                </p>  
                <p>
                    <b>His Best Decision</b>
                    <p>
                        It is undeniable that Dad has made many wonderful decisions: going to Princeton, starting his own business, 
                        having a fourth kid (still up in the air whether that was a decision or lucky surprise), and
                        being nice to the nice list only a short few. Without doubt, the best decision he ever made, was marrying Sue (mom). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only are they super cute together but she was the best and she taught him to be the best!
                    </p>
                    <div class="in-article-images" id="dad1"></div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dadding</b>
                    <p>
                        If you asked him, I bet he would say the thing he is best at in the world is inventing services 
                        that help the ultra-affluent navigate life insurance and annuity investments. But his true greatest strength
                        is dadding. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the last 34 years he taught his kids to be nice and compassionate yet competitive and sharp. He taught them
                        to prioritize education and work hard but to live life to the fullest and to allow themselves to have fun. 
                        He taught them to be inventors, rule breakers, and inquisitors. He taught them live joyfully, embrace experiences, 
                        and seek out new opportunities. He taught them to love unconditionally, care for one another deeply, and express
                        their emotions. He taught them so many things we can't capture in a paragraph or maybe in words at all. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dadding is both his talent and his skill.

                    <p>
                        The saying "work hard, play hard" has met its match with this Dad. 
                        He travels, he laughs, and he goofs.

                    For all of these reasons, and so many more, he has officially been given the title of <b><u>#1 DAD</u></b>
